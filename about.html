                <p>Our bookstore began as an idea to help support bookstores and their communities as more and more
                    people are buying their books online. We saw an opportunity to create an alternative to Amazon for
                    socially-conscious online shoppers. Amazon sells over 60% of all books in the US and is growing.
                    That shift threatens the future of bookstores and will hurt readers, authors, and publishers who
                    rely on a diverse, healthy ecosystem for books. We had a better idea — give readers the convenience
                    of online shopping while supporting independent bookstores at the same time.

                    ‍We launched in January of 2020, with just 88 bookstore partners and a team of four passionate book
                    people.

                    As the COVID-19 pandemic surged, our growing platform helped our community of independent
                    booksellers survive shutdowns. That spring, traffic to Bookshop.org hit 1 million users in a single
                    day. By the end of 2020 we had grown to over 1,000 bookstores and distributed over ten million
                    dollars in profits. Bookshop.org has since expanded internationally, launching in the UK and Spain.

                    78% of our customers said they regularly bought books from Amazon before they made the switch.</p>
                <p>Our bookstore works to connect readers with independent booksellers all over the world.
                    ‍We believe local bookstores are essential community hubs that foster culture, curiosity, and a love
                    of reading, and we're committed to helping them thrive.

                    Every purchase on the site financially supports independent bookstores. Our platform gives
                    independent bookstores tools to compete online and financial support to help them maintain their
                    presence in local communities.</p>
                <p>Our mission is simple: To help local, independent bookstores thrive in the age of ecommerce.

                    Certified as a B Corp, our bookstore puts this mission and the public good above financial
                    interests,
                    giving over 80% of our profit margin to independent bookstores. In 2022, B-Labs announced we were
                    "best for the world": in the top 5% of all B-Corps.

                    It is written in our governance documents that we will never sell the company to Amazon or any major
                    U.S. retailer.

                    As a Climate Neutral company, we are committed to operating sustainably.</p>
